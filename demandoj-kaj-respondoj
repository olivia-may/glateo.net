                <li><h2>Q. Why parentismo and not j-sistemo or something else?</h2>
                <p>A. The creator of j-sistemo, Markos Kramer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210211083523/https://lingvakritiko.com/2021/01/06/seksneutralaj-parencovortoj-rezultoj-de-opinisondo/">
                has stopped using it.</a> They use other systems. And 
                (Transir-faciliga) parentismo is comparatively well known 
                enough and would be easy for older Esperantists to pick up.</p></li>
                <li><h2>Q. Why riismo and not &#285iismo?</h2>
                <p>A. Ri is more popular as a general use pronoun. And with 
                &#285iismo it is sometimes difficult to know if one is 
                refering to an object or a person. Many LGBT Esperantists
                prefer riismo.</p>
