                <h1>Questions and Answers</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li><h2>Q. Why parentismo and not j-sistemo or something else?</h2>
                    <p>A. The creator of j-sistemo, Markos Kramer, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210211083523/https://lingvakritiko.com/2021/01/06/seksneutralaj-parencovortoj-rezultoj-de-opinisondo/">
                    has stopped using it.</a> They use other systems. And 
                    (Transir-faciliga) parentismo is comparatively well known 
                    enough and would be easy for older Esperantists to pick up.</p></li>
                    <li><h2>Q. Why riismo and not &#285iismo?</h2>
                    <p>A. Ri is more popular as a general use pronoun. And with 
                    &#285iismo it is sometimes difficult to know if one is 
                    refering to an object or a person. Many LGBT Esperantists
                    prefer riismo.</p>

                <h2>Clarification</h2>
                <p>This website uses the words "sex" as biological sex and "gender" as the way
                someone feels about themself to be more clear to trans people. It uses "they"
                as a gender-neutral first person singular pronoun (like he or she but no 
                gender).</p>
