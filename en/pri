                <h1>About This Website</h1>
                <p>I made this website because I want Esperanto to be more inclusive.
                I keep noticing there's not many women in the Esperanto community (at least
                around me) and there is some bigotry in the general community. My hope is
                this website will make the international language more inclusive and
                accepting, and if there are people turning away from Esperanto because of
                its perceived sexism, my hope is they will feel better after visiting this website.</p>

                <p><b>Thank you for visiting!</b></p>
