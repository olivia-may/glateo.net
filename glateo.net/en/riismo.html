                <h1>Riismo</h1>

                <p>Riismo is the idea of using the gender-nonspecific, third 
                person singular pronoun "Ri". You can use it to not have to 
                assume someone's gender, address someone that doesn't want to 
                be referred to by a gendered pronoun, when you don't know the
                gender of someone, or if you just don't like using gendered
                pronouns.</p>
                <p>Ri is used more with younger and LGBT Esperantists. It is
                becoming more recognized and more accepted as a pronoun.</p>
